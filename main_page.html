  <p>We took inspiration from Capture The Flag (CTF) competitions in designing these puzzles and tried to make them a bit beginner-friendly. </p>
  <p>CTF competitions are a great way to learn more about cybersecurity, though they definitely aren't the only way.</p>
  <br>
  <p>Or, if you're not into CTFs, some things you can do are generally learn more about operating systems (especially Linux),</p>
  <p> improve your programming skills, read CTF challenge write-ups,</p>
  <p>  or watch talks from DEF CON (an annual security conference) to get inspired about interesting security topics. </p>
